# AlgiersDocSource Backend

Welcome to AlgiersDocSource! This repository contains the backend code for a web application designed to facilitate document downloads for university students. The backend is built using Node.js with Express and MongoDB for data storage.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd algiers-doc-source-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:

   ```env
   PORT=3001
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/algiers-doc-source
   ```

   Adjust the `PORT` and `MONGODB_URI` values as needed.

4. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server should now be running at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure for better organization:

- **config:** Contains configuration files for the application, such as database configuration and middleware setup.
- **controllers:** Houses the logic for different features, such as file-related operations and user authentication.
- **models:** Defines data models, like `File` and `User` if using authentication.
- **routes:** Manages route definitions, separating concerns by functionality.
- **app.js:** Configures the Express application and pulls in necessary configurations.

## API Routes

- **GET /files:** Retrieve a list of files.
- **GET /files/:id:** Retrieve details of a specific file.
- **POST /files (admin only):** Upload a new file.

Feel free to customize and expand these routes based on your project requirements.
