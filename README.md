# AlgiersDocSource Backend

Welcome to AlgiersDocSource! This repository contains the backend code for a web application designed to facilitate document downloads for university students. The backend is built using Node.js with Express and MongoDB for data storage.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd algiers-doc-source-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:

   ```env
   PORT=3001
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/algiers-doc-source
   ```

   Adjust the `PORT` and `MONGODB_URI` values as needed.

4. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server should now be running at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure for better organization:

- **config:** Contains configuration files for the application, such as database configuration and middleware setup.
- **controllers:** Houses the logic for different features, such as file-related operations and user authentication.
- **models:** Defines data models, like `File` and `User` if using authentication.
- **routes:** Manages route definitions, separating concerns by functionality.
- **app.js:** Configures the Express application and pulls in necessary configurations.

## API Routes

- **GET /files:** Retrieve a list of files.
- **GET /files/:id:** Retrieve details of a specific file.
- **POST /files (admin only):** Upload a new file.

Feel free to customize and expand these routes based on your project requirements.

# Algiers Doc Source Backend

Welcome to Algiers Doc Source Backend! This backend application provides endpoints for managing "interfaces" and "linedPapers" data.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up your MongoDB connection by updating the `.env` file or using the default connection URI.

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server will be running on http://localhost:3000 by default.

## API Endpoints

### Interfaces

#### Create a new interface
- **Endpoint**: `POST /interfaces/create`
- **Request Body**: JSON data for the new interface
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Sample Interface",
    "description": "This is a sample interface.",
    "university": "Sample University",
    "language": "English",
    "downloadLinks": {
      "word": "https://example.com/word-file.docx",
      "pdf": "https://example.com/pdf-file.pdf"
    },
    "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
  }
  ```
- **Response**: JSON data for the created interface

#### Get all interfaces
- **Endpoint**: `GET /interfaces`
- **Response**: JSON array containing all interfaces

#### Get interface by ID
- **Endpoint**: `GET /interfaces/:id`
- **Response**: JSON data for the specified interface

#### Update interface by ID
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /interfaces/update/:id`
- **Request Body**: JSON data with fields to update
- **Response**: JSON data for the updated interface

#### Delete interface by ID
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /interfaces/:id`
- **Response**: JSON data for the deleted interface

### Lined Papers

#### Create a new lined paper
- **Endpoint**: `POST /lined-papers/create`
- **Request Body**: JSON data for the new lined paper
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Sample Lined Paper",
    "description": "This is a sample lined paper.",
    "category": "Sample Category",
    "downloadLink": {
      "word": "https://example.com/word-file.docx",
      "pdf": "https://example.com/pdf-file.pdf"
    },
    "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
  }
  ```
- **Response**: JSON data for the created lined paper

#### Get all lined papers
- **Endpoint**: `GET /lined-papers`
- **Response**: JSON array containing all lined papers

#### Get lined paper by ID
- **Endpoint**: `GET /lined-papers/:id`
- **Response**: JSON data for the specified lined paper

#### Update lined paper by ID
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /lined-papers/update/:id`
- **Request Body**: JSON data with fields to update
- **Response**: JSON data for the updated lined paper

#### Delete lined paper by ID
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /lined-papers/:id`
- **Response**: JSON data for the deleted lined paper

## Roadmap for Testing

1. Use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to send requests to the provided endpoints.
2. Test creating new interfaces and lined papers using the respective `POST` endpoints.
3. Retrieve all interfaces and lined papers using the `GET` endpoints.
4. Retrieve specific interfaces and lined papers using the `GET` endpoints with specific IDs.
5. Update existing interfaces and lined papers using the respective `PUT` endpoints.
6. Delete existing interfaces and lined papers using the respective `DELETE` endpoints.

Feel free to explore and test different scenarios with these endpoints!
